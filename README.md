Web-Components
==============

To run the project you need a local web server. If you have Python installed you can run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.
If you're more a Node.js person you can simply run `http-server` after you've installed it (`npm i -g http-server`).

There's one `index.html` file that is importing and using the other two CSS modules.

If you are starting with Web Components I suggest this article from Eric Biedelman: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/shadowdom
